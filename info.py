who_am_i = """
I am Yichuan Liu, born in Hannover, Germany, and raised in a family of Chinese origin. My upbringing spanned various countries, primarily Germany and China, with a brief period in the United States. This multinational environment played a crucial role in shaping my academic and personal development.

Residing in Germering, Germany, I was immersed in an environment characterized by its structure and order, aspects that greatly influenced my approach to learning and problem-solving. At home, Chinese traditions and language were predominant, providing me with a dual cultural perspective and bilingual proficiency in German and Mandarin.

The short duration spent in the United States added a different dimension to my cultural exposure, introducing me to diverse ideas and methodologies. It was a period that enhanced my adaptability and furthered my interest in global perspectives.

Throughout my education, I navigated multiple school systems, adapting to different academic environments. This experience, though challenging, fostered resilience and a capacity for rapid adaptation. My academic interests have consistently centered around science and technology, a field where I aim to make significant contributions.

In summary, my background is marked by diverse cultural experiences and educational environments, each contributing to my development as a globally aware individual with a strong foundation in science and technology.
